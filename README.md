# 🤖 Chatbox Application with AI Integration

## 📌 Overview

This project is a **Chatbox Application** built as part of an assignment to demonstrate integration with an AI API and effective state management using **Redux Toolkit (React)**.

The application enables users to send messages and receive AI-generated responses in real time. It focuses on clean UI/UX, efficient asynchronous handling, and a scalable architecture.

## 🚀 Features

### 💬 User Interaction

- Send messages through an input field
- Receive real-time AI responses
- Dynamic chat interface

### 🔄 State Management (Redux)

- Store chat history (user + AI messages)
- Manage loading state during API calls
- Handle error states with user-friendly messages
- Async API handling using **createAsyncThunk**

### 🌐 API Integration

- Integrated with **Gemini API**
- Secure API key using environment variables
- Proper request-response handling
- Error handling for network/API issues

### 🎨 UI/UX

- Clean and intuitive chat interface
- Left-right message alignment (User vs AI)
- Typing animation (loading indicator)
- Markdown rendering for structured responses
- Fully responsive design (mobile + desktop)

### ⚡ Performance

- Smooth UI interactions without lag
- Efficient rendering using Redux
- Handles multiple messages seamlessly

## 🏗️ Architecture

The project follows a **4-layer architecture**:

```text
UI Layer        → React Components (ChatLayout, MessageBubble)
Hook Layer      → Custom Hooks (useChat)
State Layer     → Redux Toolkit (chatSlice, store)
Service Layer   → API Calls (chatService)
```
